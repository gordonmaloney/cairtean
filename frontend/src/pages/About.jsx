        Càirtean is a flashcard app for learning Scottish Gaelic.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is designed to aid students learning with the Duolingo course, but
        also allows you to add your own words. It uses a{" "}

        'spaced-repition' algorithm to maximise your retention, and make sure
        you remember what you learn.
        <br />
        <br />
        The name <em>Càirtean</em> is the Gaelic for "cards", but it is
        pronounced almost identically to <em>càirdean</em> - "friends".

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Long-story short, you add cards with vocabulary you want to learn to
        your deck, and you revise them.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you are adding cards, you can chose to add your own custom cards,
        or add the words from a level in Duolingo. This way, you can help
        reinforce the vocabulary you are learning there.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you're revising, you have three options - 'wrong', 'correct', or
        'easy'. Depending on your answer, Càirtean will show you that word again
        at the optimum time - later the better you know it.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means you can focus your energy in the most efficient way possible
        - revising the words you need to, and not spending too much time on the
        words you already know.
        <br />
        <br />
        For millions of language learners around the world, this method - known
        as 'spaced-repetition' has revolutionised vocab learning. If you study
        regularly, I hope it will do the same for you.
